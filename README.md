# Task 2
## What I learned
What ‘bruteforcing’ involves
How to respond to a ransomware virus using Python

Write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file, to avoid paying a ransom

ransomware couldn't completely install, so it only managed to encrypt one zip file. 
there isn’t any guarantee that the decryption key will be provided or that the attackers won’t strike again in the future

bruteforce the decryption key; feasible because:copy-pasted payloads and immediately tried to use ransomware instead of moving around laterally on the network
